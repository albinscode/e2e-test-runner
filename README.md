**e2e-test-runner** is a ready-to-use E2E test runner that leverages Cypress and Cucumber.

It provides a collection of pre-implemented reusable steps to simplify writing and maintaining end-to-end tests for your
applications.

## Features

- 🧪 Predefined Cucumber steps for HTTP requests and assertions
- 🧰 Built-in context system with template rendering (via Nunjucks)
- ⚙️ Compatible with Cypress and Cucumber ecosystem
- 🚀 Run tests via Node or Docker

## Technologies

- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
- [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)

## Installation

### Option 1: use image from docker hub

You can pull and run the prebuilt image directly from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull vincentmoittie/e2e-test-runner:latest
```

### Option 2: Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zorin95670/e2e-test-runner e2e
```

Make sure to include `e2e` in your `.gitignore` if it's only for local use.

### Option 3: Use as a Git submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/zorin95670/e2e-test-runner e2e
```

Then install dependencies:

```bash
cd e2e
npm install
```

## 🚀 Running Tests

### 🔧 Required Environment Variable

The test runner **requires** the environment variable `CYPRESS_FEATURES_PATH`.

* It must point to the directory containing your `.feature` files.
* The path should be **relative to the current working directory** (i.e., where `npm run start` is executed).
* For example, in a Java project structure, if the test runner is executed from the `e2e` folder, the correct value
  would typically be:

```env
CYPRESS_FEATURES_PATH=../src/test/resources/features
```

You must define this variable in a `.env` file or inject it at runtime.

### 📦 Local Execution (with `dotenv`)

To run the test runner locally and load environment variables from a `.env` file:

1. Install [`dotenv-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-cli) globally:

```bash
npm install -g dotenv-cli
```

2. Run the test runner:

```bash
dotenv -e ../.env -- npm run start
# With ui
dotenv -e ../.env -- npm run start:ui
```

### 🐳 Run via Docker

To run the test runner in a Docker container, make sure to:

* Provide access to the `.env` file.
* Set the timezone (e.g., `Europe/Paris`) using the `TZ` environment variable.
* Connect the container to the appropriate Docker network (e.g., to communicate with your application under test).

Example:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --env-file .env \
  --env TZ=Europe/Paris \
  --network my-app-network \
  -v "$(pwd)/src/test/resources/features":/app/src/test/resources/features \
  vincentmoittie:e2e-test-runner:latest
```

Or one-line version:

```bash
docker run --rm --env-file .env --env TZ=Europe/Paris --network my-app-network  -v "$(pwd)/src/test/resources/features":/app/src/test/resources/features vincentmoittie:e2e-test-runner:latest
```

> Replace `my-app-network` with the name of the Docker network your application is running on.

### 🐳 Run via local Docker

To run the test runner in a Docker container, make sure to:

* Mount the project directory.
* Provide access to the `.env` file.
* Set the timezone (e.g., `Europe/Paris`) using the `TZ` environment variable.
* Connect the container to the appropriate Docker network (e.g., to communicate with your application under test).

Example:

```bash
docker build e2e -t e2e-test-runner
docker run --rm \
  --env-file .env \
  --env TZ=Europe/Paris \
  --network my-app-network \
  -v "$(pwd)/src/test/resources/features":/app/src/test/resources/features \
  e2e-test-runner
```

Or one-line version:

```bash
docker run --rm --env-file .env --env TZ=Europe/Paris --network my-app-network  -v "$(pwd)/src/test/resources/features":/app/src/test/resources/features e2e-test-runner
```

> Replace `my-app-network` with the name of the Docker network your application is running on.

## Usage

The test runner supports writing tests in Gherkin using `.feature` files.

### Example Feature

```gherkin
Feature: Basic HTTP check

  Scenario: GET Google homepage
    When I request "https://www.google.com" with method "GET"
    Then I expect status code is 200
```

### Using Nunjucks in Step Values

You can use [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) templating syntax inside step values. This allows dynamic
content, especially useful when injecting data from environment variables or shared context.

#### Example with environment variable

```gherkin
Given I set http header "Authorization" with "Bearer {{ ctx.AUTH_TOKEN }}"
```

#### JSON formatting support

A custom `json` filter has been added to Nunjucks to properly serialize objects into formatted JSON strings.

```gherkin
Then I log "{{ response.body | json }}"
```

This is useful for debugging or displaying formatted JSON output directly from the response.

### Context System

This test runner provides a built-in context system to share data between steps.
It is designed to simplify dynamic value handling, templating, and state tracking during test execution.

| Key           | Description                                                                                                      |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `env`         | Contains all environment variables. Useful for configuration and templating.                                     |
| `ctx`         | A customizable object used to store any custom data needed during the test flow. **Reset before each scenario.** |
| `response`    | Stores the last HTTP response. **Reset before each scenario.**                                                   |
| `httpHeaders` | Stores all HTTP headers set via step definitions. **Reset before each scenario.**                                |

**Example Usage**

You can also use the context in templated strings (via Nunjucks):

```gherkin
When I request "{{ env.API_URL }}/users/{{ ctx.userId }}" with method "GET"
```

### 🔤 Supported `<type>` values

Certain steps allow you to specify a `type` to interpret or convert values properly.
The following types are supported:

| Type      | Description                                                                      |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `string`  | Default type. Values are kept as-is.                                             |
| `integer` | Converts the value to a JavaScript integer (e.g., `"42"` → `42`).                |
| `float`   | Converts the value to a JavaScript float (e.g., `"3.14"` → `3.14`).              |
| `boolean` | Converts the value to a boolean (`"true"` → `true`, `"false"` → `false`).        |
| `json`    | Parses the value as a JSON object (e.g., `"{ \"foo\": 123 }"` → `{ foo: 123 }`). |

📌 These types are used to ensure that context variables, assertions, and request parameters behave as expected during
test execution.

### 📊 Using `<dataTable>`

In some steps like:

```gherkin
When I request "<url>" with method "<method>" with query parameters
```

You can define a `DataTable` in your Gherkin file to pass query parameters dynamically.

The table must include at least `key` and `value`, and may optionally include a `type` column:

```gherkin
When I request "/api/search" with method "GET" with query parameters
| key       | value      | type     |
| q         | banana     | string   |
| limit     | 10         | integer  |
| exact     | true       | boolean  |
```

| Column  | Required | Description                                                             |
|---------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `key`   | ✅        | The name of the query parameter.                                        |
| `value` | ✅        | The value to assign to the key.                                         |
| `type`  | ❌        | Optional type conversion (see supported types above). Default: `string` |

✅ The table is evaluated with Nunjucks, so you can dynamically reference values like `{{ ctx.foo }}`.

### 🏷️ Tags

You can use tags to control which scenarios or features to run during test execution:

#### ✅ Skip a single scenario

Use `@skip` above a scenario to skip it.

```gherkin
Feature: User login

  @skip
  Scenario: Valid credentials
    Given I visit the login page
    When I enter valid credentials
    Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
```

#### ✅ Run only one scenario

Use `@only` above a scenario to run **only that one**. All others will be ignored.

```gherkin
Feature: User login

  @only
  Scenario: Invalid credentials
    Given I visit the login page
    When I enter invalid credentials
    Then I should see an error message
```

#### ✅ Skip an entire feature

Use `@skip` above the `Feature:` line to skip **all scenarios** in that file.

```gherkin
@skip
Feature: Password recovery

  Scenario: Request password reset
    Given I visit the forgot password page
    When I enter my email
    Then I should receive a reset email
```

### 📦 Database

1. Setup db client with connection string

```gherkin
Given I setup database with connection string "<connectionString>"

# Example:
Given I setup database with connection string "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/db"
```

2. Setup db client with full connection details

```gherkin
Given I setup database with driver "<driver>" host "<host>" port <port> user "<user>" password "<password>" database "<database>"
# Example:
Given I setup database with driver "postgres" host "localhost" port 5432 user "user" password "password" database "db"
```

3. Search db results on table with filter and columns

```gherkin
Given I search db table "<table>" with filter "<filter>" and columns "<columns>"

# Example:
Given I search db table "users" with filter "name = 'doe' and surname = 'john'" and columns "id name surname"
```

3. Expect db search results to a given length

```gherkin
Given I expect "<expectedLength>" db results
# Example:
Given I expect 2 db results
```

4. Delete all search results previously found

```gherkin
Given I delete all db results
# Example:
Given I delete all db results
```

5. Add a new ldap entry with dn and with raw attributes

```gherkin
Given I add a row to table "<table>" with values "<values>"
# Example:
Given I add a row to table "users" with values
"""
{
    "name": "Doe",
    "surname": "John",
}
"""
```
